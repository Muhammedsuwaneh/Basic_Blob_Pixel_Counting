# Basic Blob Finding and Pixel counting Project

Operations - 
1. The Program reads a .txt file contaning the blobs
2. The blobs are scanned / searched.
3. When a blob is found, the number of pixels it contains is counted recursively
4. The pixel count is then used compute the number of center of it's mass on the x and y cordinates of the .txt file
5. The results get printed on the console together with the blobs.
